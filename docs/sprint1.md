### Sprint 1

#### Retrospective

* **Did well**:
  * **Focused Delivery of Core Features**: We successfully developed features that cover key aspects of the app's functionality-car registration, messaging from security to students and vehicle-related notifications. These features are central to the app's purpose and show clear alignment with user needs.
  * **Accurate Estimation and Task Completion**: We estimated our workload realistically during Sprint Planning and managed to complete everything we committed to.
* **Do differently**:
  * **Improved Task Separation**: We need to break tasks down into smaller, more independent units so that each task can be worked on without waiting for the completion of others.
* **Puzzles**:
  * **Concerns about Integrating Google Maps Navigation**: We have uncertainties about whether itâ€™s possible to integrate the Google Maps navigation system into our app. Additionally, we need to assess if this integration is feasible within the scope of the current sprint.
