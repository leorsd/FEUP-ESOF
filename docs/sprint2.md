### Sprint 2

#### Retrospective

* **Did well**:
  * **Successful Development of Key Areas**: Building on the existing map functionality, this sprint focused on adding interactivity through pop-ups that display parking lot details upon selection. Alongside this, we integrated real-time occupancy data. These additions contribute to a more dynamic and informative interface, supporting quicker user decision-making and better situational awareness.
  * **Responded to Feedback & Raised the Bar**: In the previous sprint, we were told we could aim higher-and we did. This time, we completed all initially planned user stories with time to spare. Instead of slowing down, we took the initiative to add an additional feature (supporting all university parking lots), expanding the scope and value of the release.

* **Did poorly**:
  * **Ad Hoc Decision-Making**: The decision to expand scope mid-sprint, while well-executed, wasn’t clearly documented or discussed as a team in a structured way. This could cause confusion or misalignment in bigger teams or future sprints.

* **Do differently**:
  * **Structured Scope Expansion**: In future sprints, if additional work becomes available after completing the initial sprint goals, we should handle it through a structured decision-making process — clearly documenting, discussing, and aligning as a team before expanding the sprint scope. This will help maintain focus, transparency, and predictability.
